When you serve people drinks, let them finish said drinks before hastily removing them from the table. If they kindly ask you for their drinks back, try not to be an ass. \n3. When customers order dinner, try not to take so long so as to confuse them into thinking it\"s breakfast. \n4. When the food is served, maybe don\"t go MIA. Maybe check back in with them. Maybe they want dessert for ... wait what time is it now... lunch?  \n\nOK I\"ll stop there. I know how valuable time is to the pretentious staff at the Windsor.

A big salad is not an appetizer, it"s an entree. And by big, I mean BIG. Only about 5 or 6 falafels, but a ton of greens. The grilled veggie burrito doesn"t have very great flavor. A lot of ginger, but not much of anything else. The thing that bothered me most about this item was that they rolled the foil *into* my burrito. So, the only way I could eat the thing was by tearing the burrito apart and trying to remove the foil from my food. This resulted in a mess. Fix this, Pita Jungle. It also bums me that the vegan options are so meager. If they just offered vegan bread and lavosh I"d be able to try more of the items. I"d love the portabello burger or the veggie burger. Alas, dairy.\n\nAt least I can say that the P.J. staff is very attentive and friendly.

The place was pretty empty right off the bat, so bad sign there. Decided to go with the grilled vegetable burrito with black beans, brown rice, habanero salsa and guacamole. \n\nThe first thing I didn"t like was that the same employee who was preparing food was also ringing up customers. This is *never* acceptable. I don"t care if you put gloves on, you shouldn"t have an employee handling both currency and food. It"s disgusting. Where was the manager? \n\nSecondly, my burrito was poorly wrapped. I ended up with more of a sphere than a cylinder. Furthermore, the foil didn"t cover the burrito, so of course it fell apart as I ate.\n\nThirdly, I didn"t order any dairy (lactose intolerant) but there was definitely a taste of sour cream in my food. Not sure if it was some sour cream that got spilled on the lettuce (noticed that on the line) or if sour cream was added to the guacamole to stretch the amount, or if that"s just how Qdoba"s food tastes. Concerning to say the least, but at least I didn"t get sick.\n\nFinally, the thing that bothered me the most, was that the food was SO, so oily. My mouth was coated with oil for an hour afterwards. I can only assume the oil was from the grilled vegetables, but it could have been from something else. Truly, I don"t mind cooking with a lot of oil but this was over the top. I almost get the feeling they had an accident and drenched the veggies by mistake. You really don"t need much if any oil to cook zucchini and squash. The water will release and keep from sticking.\n\nThe grilled vegetables were the thing I was most excited about at Qdoba, but quickly became the aspect I liked the least.\n\nTL;DR oily food, poorly wrapped, gross handling practice. \n\n2/5 will not return.", "business_id": "Vak7jP7fu6LUxQDZmSZE3g", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-06-03", "type": "review"},

I love her. But I also like this very tall African American woman who"s name I can"t recall. She cut my hair last time & did a phenomenal job. I"m prone to flyaways & my hair is fine. She worked my hair just right to help me hide my flyaways & give my hair volume.\n\nSo yes, I still worry about my hair. But it"s not as bad as it used to be. I"m comfortable knowing I"ll leave feeling & looking better.\n\nI sure as heck won"t pay $30+ for a salon cut. Only time I"ve done that was the only time my fears were completely founded.

When we walked up, 2 blonde waitrons were at the door, holding it open for us, saying "Just so you know we just called last call, and aren\"t serving food. In fact, we should already be closed." CHARMED! So, a music-themed restaurant/bar, located directly across from an arena that frequently hosts ummm, CONCERTS, wouldn\"t plan to capitalize on the outflow of excited music fans and perhaps stay open  and make some monayyy? OK. As a bartender, I\"d have insisted that it be so. This summer sucked for the service industry, and I found it so surprising that such an establishment wouldn\"t have been more malleable to perhaps retain and dare I say, boost the morale of their  staff by anticipating and catering to a late crowd of people who\"d rather spend $5 (ok, $5.46) as opposed to $11 @ the arena for some post-concert frosty bevs. Have a little bump in their take-home scrilla for the night, and I dunno, fun? Meh.\n\nAnd there were about 15 other people in there at the bar, too. The only person there who was workin it was the bartendress, though, she too, seemed like she was a bit put-out that she had a bunch of customers come in last-minute. I do give her props for salting the rim of my pint glass and pouring a DosXX for me without having the salt volcano all the beer out of the glass. \n\nMaybe it\"s the corporate management bs that was in the way.

There were barely any people there yet. I got there at 6:30 and ended up pretty close to the stage.\n\nFrisking & pat downs - These will be done by a same gendered person. Girls, they\"ll want to look in your purse.\nThis is pretty much against the 4th Amendment:\n"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated..." \nBut if you bitch they have the right to refuse service/entrance. Fun!\n\nDecor & cleanliness - It\"s pretty dirty everywhere. But that\"s to be expected. Lots of people coming & going all the time. You\"ll look up to see that the ceiling is bare & exposed. Pray your bladder holds out on you until you can get to another location. Don\"t even go into the restrooms if you don\"t have to, you\"ll wish you had a hazsmat suit on. Yuck!\n\nDrinks - There\"s a bar & they don\"t separate people under 21. I imagine it would be easy for an older friend to get under 21 people drunk in the crowd :D\n\nHeat - It\"s constantly hot. No matter what the weather outside is like go dressed like you do in the middle of summer phx heat. There was 1 lousy fan blowing.

When it\"s a store putting it on for the sake of it\"s customers (and I\"d like to think as a thank you for loyalty) it goes far beyond a vehicle for making a sale.\n\nWe have loved the Garage Sale that this location put on for so very long. We would get in line at 5am with the other die hards and laugh at the people waking up in their sleeping bags (while secretly wishing that we had the cojones to do the same since they were going to get the VERY best deals). A couple years running Krispy Kreme came across the street with boxes of donuts to cheer our early morning wait.\n\nBut it was the people that made it. We\"d hang out in the early morning hours with other outdoor enthusiasts trading stories and secrets about local trails, lakes and camping sites.\n\n...and then, with nervous excitement we\"d charge into the parking lot like mad men, snatching up sleeping bags and hiking shoes for pennies on the dollar, thanking the REI gods that we, the chosen few, the members, would have such an opportunity to feed our equipment cravings at unheard of prices.\n\nFlash forward to yesterday...I evidently missed the memo that the "new and improved" garage sale was happening in the store, up in the clinic room. Clutching my 20% off coupon we made our way through the crowded parking lot, J. with visions of using it for a new bike seat while I ready to fight him for a chance to restock my hiking sock drawer at 20% savings. We walked in to signs advertising the garage sale and  a very long line of people waiting to go up stairs for their finds of the year. J. got in line and I went to hunt for new feet cushions. Several minutes later, he found me to let me know that he had to get out of line to get tickets for the sale, but was assured that it was a 30 minute wait and he was going to  the bike department until our numbers were called.\n\nI was dubious...the line looked like it was for an E-ticket ride at Disneyland and the people in it weren\"t looking any happier than if it was 98\xba with screaming kids at said park. Long story short...it was 2 full hours before we were called to that upstairs secret clubhouse. Once there, we were told we had a very generous 10 minutes to shop...we picked up a few things. set them down in frustration when neither of us could get to the clothes and walked out of the store empty handed.\n\nREI management, this is an epic fail in my opinion. You turned a wonderful community event into a vehicle to hold your members hostage in hopes of their making full price purchases while waiting for a disappointing chance to make the killer buy that we dreamed yearly about...and worse yet, you didn\"t even make the sale that we intended...you didn\"t sell the $53 bike seat, you didn\"t sell the $17.95 socks but you did manage to piss off a couple of members who have been on your roster for 25 years.\n\nSometimes a sales event is more than the sum of the profits or in this case the decluttering of the returns bin. Sometimes it\"s a way to show your customers the loyalty they\"ve shown you... we heard repeatedly that this was much easier on the employees and management than the old parking lot sale. This was much harder on us as consumers and so unsatisfying to wait two hours for a 10 minute opportunity. The parking lot sale was  one day of chaos for the employees a couple times a year...is that too much to ask from a store that we\"ve been loyal too for half our lives?", "business_id": "vNQn_2P3lJh_-uBhRuSc3Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-04-15", "type": "review"},

We walked in, grabbed a menu and the minute I saw Buttermilk Pancakes with Chopped Bacon I was sold. There is seating inside and outside; when they"re busy they go through the line and assign you a table number based on the size of your group. This makes things move smoothly unless yo"re rude and decide that your assigned table isn"t good enough for you. Yes, people really do that.\n\nThere are several things that make these pancakes amazing. When they"re on the griddle they sprinkle cooked, chopped bacon on the wet side, flip it and serve. It"s genius. Then they put a wrapped butter pad on each pancake. This is awesome, because the butter starts to melt. There is nothing worse than rock hard, cold butter that tears apart your pancakes as you try to spread it. It comes with a side of syrup that is good, but doesn"t overpower the flavor of the pancake itself. \n\nThey carry Revolution Tea which makes my hubby very happy. Their French Press of Stump Town Coffee is very tasty, but their latte tasted way too burnt and just wasn"t enjoyable. \n\nAt some point, I will venture out and try one of their amazing burgers or pizzas which all look amazing.

What was happening at the outdoor bar was a huge gay circuit party, which was kind of awesome to see on a Sunday afternoon. We veered left, to grab some food before shoehorning ourselves into the Rebar gaiety. Service was a little weird in that we kind of stood around waiting for someone to acknowledge us and be seated - Do we go inside, just have a seat? what? But then we were cheerfully seated on the patio without much waiting. \n\nNitty-gritty: chips and salsa were good, but the salsa was totally the old spicy smoky one they had at Ticoz, I swears! (loved it then, not sure what the slight twist they did to it for Bliss, but it"s aight still)\n\nTortilla pizza thing with the pesto, tomato and mozz: meh. there was no zip to it. Very oily and heavy.\n\nShrimp tempura tacos? Some tasty business. Generously filled with fattie shrimps, and just fresh, crispy and delicious. Didn"t come served with any lemon wedges, so we totally ghetto fished the wedges out of our water glasses, and it made a big diff. \n\nNot so great was waiting half an hour for our cocktail order. That"s the sucky thing about restaurant service when the waiter has to depend on the bar to make drinks for them. Considering how slammed the bar was with cocktailing "mos, I understand, but it makes for bad service over on the restaurant side. We were comped our delicious white sangrias for having to wait so long, and that was very much appreciated.\n\nAnd then, we went to the bar. It was less packed than when we arrived, but still pretty populated, the bartender, David, was just catching up and picking up all the crap he had to clean up after being hit so hard. I thought he was the only bartender there, but it turns out there was another one at the decidedly less busy inside bar area. Didn"t seem like outdoor guy had much help, which sucks. I"m sure they made good money that day, but could have probably made a sh*t-ton more with better staffing. \n\nDespite David clearly being pummelled, he was amazingly even-tempered, gracious and polite, and made excellent cocktails, though we had to coach him (only the once) to chill the vodka in our bombers. It was a great place to be on a Sunday afternoon, just hanging out, unpretentious, and 2-4-1 doesn"t suck one bit.

The bagels are good..they really are. So why do you have to cheap out on the amount of  ingredients in the sandwiches? Are you not making enough profit??? Come on, now...\n\nI kinda stopped coming here a while ago because at $5.49 for a Nova Lox and Bagel I kind of want to at least have the bagel moistened with cream cheese  and have a couple more chips of lox on there with the 3 or 4 capers that garnish it. Ok, I might be over exaggerating a bit, but really, they go rather thin at this location. So I stopped coming here and would go to Desert Ridge to get my occasional fix.\n\nFast forward to present. Got a bunch of coupons in the newspaper and decided to give it a second chance, so have come here 3 times in the past week. Here are my experiences (note that experience #1 is going to be corporate, across the board and has nothing to do with quantity and everything to do with design and marketing):\n\n1. Came in with coupon for new bagel poppers and coffee to enjoy on business road trip to Sedona. Poppers are featured in a cup with a lid leading one to believe they are an easy to eat finger food. DON"T BE FOOLED! The cream cheese poppers have a coating on them so slick that when you grab one between two fingers in explodes from your hand and projectiles into your windshield where it sticks and slowly slides off. Ok, not really, but seriously, I couldn\"t get them out of the cup, they kept slipping out of my fingers. I bought their self named car cup to only find out that it didn\"t fit in my cup holder and the first gentle turn I made out of the mall had the cup in my lap and me dancing in a seat of hot coffee. Add to that the aggravation that the guy taking the order wasn\"t sure how to ring it up because I got the car cup and....\n\n#2  This actually went ok. Second coupon and things went smoothly, coffee good, bagel fresh and while cream cheese was a little thinner than what I like was adequate.\n\n#3  Now today....ohhhh, today. I was ravenous...ate too lightly for dinner last night and didn\"t make it out of the house for breakfast until almost 10am. So, today\"s coupon is buy one bagel, get one free. Never thought about how much that schmear of cream cheese was until I had to actually look at the menu...$1.50, ok, times two bagels, 3 bucks, well, ok. Asked to have my two bagels toasted with cream cheese. First they come to me and inform me that they were out of one of my bagels. Ok. Then, when my order is called up the guy doing so makes fun of my name (my nickname is \"Cia, most think it very pretty, but it kind of loses its charm when the guy behind the counter yells out "Cia! [snicker] C-I-A!). Went to pick up the bagels and the cream cheese was scraped on sooo thin it was almost none existent. Complained...got a dirty look from the guy that spelled my name and the guy that took my order "informed" me that if I wanted it thicker I needed to ask for "heavy" when I placed my order...yeah, dude, uhhhm, I just wanted to actually be able to SEE the cream cheese on the bagel before I ate it. And the punchline? Get back to my table and it turns out one of the bagels wasn\"t even toasted.\n\nEinstein\"s...is it so hard to get it right? One out of three experiences in a week\"s time acceptable is, well, kind of unacceptable.", "business_id": "rua7dvP6-SUXL4N8RTY--A", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-09-11", "type": "review"},

I was happy to have found this place earlier this year but I will now just cook my food at home. \n\nI was the first person in the restaurant and placed my order. Family members of the waitress walked in and became priority. They received multiple banchan right away and had food served to them after they ordered while I sat around with just barley water. Initially when I had even asked for barley water the waitress acted like it was a hassle to even have to serve it and told me they didn"t have any. \n\nMy banchan came with my meal and there were three items. A couple came in next to me and ordered and asked for cabbage kimchi and was told they couldn"t have any because it didn"t go with the meal. Excuse me?! As a Korean, I have never seen ANYONE been told they can"t have banchan. I told the couple that wasn"t standard service that is usually received from that waitress in other occasions. I asked the waitress for more banchan and in a serious tone she told me she didn"t have any more to give me.\n\nI had planned on ordering food for my husband to take home and she put the check on my table while I was still in the middle of my meal.  Her priority became watching the soap opera on tv rather than service. \n\nSpeaking of the meal, my jampong consisted mostly of peppers. Pure disappointment. \n\nI felt as though I received prejudiced service. I was speaking Korean and attempting to be polite, but all she saw in her eyes was a half white person who she didn"t have time for. I called my mom enraged after the meal and she agreed that for some meals you don"t necessarily serve certain banchan but if someone asks for it you should oblige. \n\nI will not enter this establishment again.", "business_id": "sjO66SM-zICJr5VyumMuqA", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-09-21", "type": "review"},

The stadium itself is nice, but not the best place for a concert, especially one with such a grand set-up and special effects. Bono explained that with this tour, they\"re going for "intimacy on a grand scale." The intimacy was definitely missing at this venue! Since that element was a conscious effort on the band\"s part, imagine a show where that wasn\"t the intention -- you\"d feel even farther away from the performers. \n\nIt sorta felt like the venue was competing with, rather than supporting, the music. From the first drumbeat on, I was overwhelmed with a feeling of wanting to shut out the stadium itself and focus on the music. Could have been a lot worse -- could have been better. Was confused and bummed at the images on the 360 screen during "City of Blinding Lights" and "Unforgettable Fire" (ohmigod -- to hear that live -- never would I have dreamed!) -- could have been so beautiful, but something was wrong. It\"s possible that the place was too lit up for the images to be clear on the screen, or there was some sort of malfunction. I don\"t know. \n\nThe bathroom lines were ridiculous, but the facilities were clean. I do have one thing to say: don\"t block the sinks for everyone else just to primp! Witness the crowds behind you! Wash your hands and then, use your own mirror; I see one in your hands with your face powder. I know you want to look gorgeous for the guys on stage, but your pores are NOT going to be visible from where you\"re standing. Sheesh. I totally relate to being worked up for these performers but I also need to use the sink.\n\nDidn\"t visit any concessions so can\"t comment on those. Overall, staff were great and concert-goers were pretty polite, but then, I wasn\"t on the Floor where the crazy general admission mosh was going on. Heard later that there were a lot of mean drunks. Whassup, aren\"t U2 fans supposed to be more humane than average? I guess people are people...\n\nWe had 17th row, on Adam\"s side of the stage.

I\"ll tell you why; or at least, why not to select this buffet.\n\nBeing greeted on the way in with a "You are on camera" sign sure is welcoming.  I was quickly greeted, though, and directed to my seat.  My drink order was taken before I even sat down, which was nice.  Too many buffets have you walk in, sit down, select a beverage, stand up, and proceed to self-service, and it was nice to save a couple of steps.\n\nBut then I got to the food.  Nearly everything had the congealed look of having been out too long; the skin on the surface of the sweet-and-sour sauce was rubbery and at least a half-centimeter thick.  Not exactly appetizing.  I did, however, find some acceptable-looking specimens and returned to my table.\n\nThe warmest of the foods could only generously be called lukewarm; most of the chicken was marbled with glibbery wads of fat, and all the sauces tasted sugary and generic.  I could literally not tell the "orange chicken" from the "sesame chicken" from the "pepper chicken" by any sense other than sight.\n\nThe rice was room-temperature, but I barely know this because as I was forking a mouthful of rice together on the plate, the alternately obsequious and intrusive waitstaff tried to take my plate out from under me (though, in retrospect, they may have been trying to save me).\n\nThe fruit selection, which I also sampled, looked fine, but was in fact soggy and also room-temperature to lukewarm.\n\nThey have a somewhat vast dessert selection -- particularly for a buffet -- but I\"d more than had my fill.\n\nWalking toward the register, there was a prominent sign re-advising me that walk-outs are recorded and will be reported to the police and prosecuted.

She never came back with tofu or to tell us if I was wrong. So, I didn"t get what I ordered and the server never bothered to fix the mistake.\n\nMy girlfriend got the Vegetable Chow Fun which she said was flavorless.

Unfortunately, Lalibela will have to settle for being 2nd best.\n\nI cam here with my girlfriend for Valentine\"s Day last week. It was our first time to Lalibela, but we\"re no strangers to Ethiopian food. So, we made reservations, were quickly brought to our table and everything was swell.\n\nThey offered a Valentine\"s day menu, so we ordered the vegetarian special. It was about $36 and was allegedly a meal for two. Odd, because on their regular menu they have a meal for 3 at $38. In retrospect, we probably should have paid the extra $2 and taken home more leftovers. More bang for your buck.\n\nEither way, it\"s a pretty steep price for Ethiopian food. Most of which is very cheap to make as our meal was mostly peas, lentils, potatoes, salad and cabbage. \n\nWe also got a bottle of Yellow Tail merlot @ ~$18. Both our food and our wine came out very quickly. And that was pretty much the last time we saw our server for the rest of the meal.\n\nI will hand it to Lalibela, the food is good. Very good. Perhaps even better than Blue Nile. But the price is steep and the lack of service really spoiled the night for us. It\"s not as if the place was busy. By the time our meal was finished there was only 3 other tables with patrons at them but none of them were receiving any service. Sure, we knew there were waitresses. We could hear them talking in the kitchen so they must exist! After maybe 15-20 minutes of sitting waiting on our check, empty water and no service to speak of I actually had go up to the front desk and wave down our waitress. This is completely unacceptable for any restaurant. Short of an emergency, there is no reason why a dining room should be left unattended for 15 minutes while there are guests. My feeling was that the servers got their food out and that\"s all that mattered. No "How\"s the food?" no refills on waters. Nothing.\n\nOn top of that, Lalibela\"s menu lacks the diversity of Blue Nile. Not only does Blue Nile have great veg options, but they have sambusas, hummus, falafel, salads and a raw vegan menu. Lalibela just has about a dozen or so meat and vegetable dishes. Likely all that could be found at Blue Nile for a much lower price.\n\nI can understand why people come here. The food is good (the injera is certainly better than Blue Nile\"s), but the lack of service and the price are enough to keep me out of Lalibela for good.", "business_id": "-bd26a1QEEpqUZjBmtBUiQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-02-20", "type": "review"},

My husband DOES NOT eat sashimi or nigiri and decided to try it and loved it!! I was shocked. Since he enjoyed it he decided to try some of the "Screaming O" I ordered and ended up eating most of it himself. Sushi Catcher has officially made him a sashimi lover. \n\nThe highlight hands down had to be the soft shell crab appetizer. It came served with two sauces -- a soy and a creamy sauce. The batter was so incredibly light and flaky, unlike anything we\"d ever had before. My husband described it as powder in his mouth. Not an overly crunchy shell and just a succulent inside. Being from the mid-Atlantic, I\"m fairly picky about my soft shell crab. Steamed blue crabs with Old Bay are typically my crab of choice, but this is now my number one. No joke.

Last Friday night, me and my family wanted to go out for pizza, we decided on Nello"s because we haven"t been there in YEARS. The waitress took our order right away, we ordered the cheesey garlic toast, house salad (no olives), and a thin crust cheese pizza. The garlic bread was so good, was the only thing I actually enjoyed. The salad came out and was missing all of the meat, it was just yellowed iceberg lettuce, carrot shavings, and a scant amount of cheese. We asked the waitress about the missing meat and she said she would bring it... it never came. The pizza arrived and was horridly undercooked, the cheese wasn"t even melted in the middle! At this point i was just done, and super sad for my dining experience. We asked for our check and it took (no exaggeration) 13 minutes to get it. With two young kids this felt like ETERNITY.  She dropped it off finnaalllyy and we paid with a card. While all of this was happening there was either a regular or a local celebrity that was seated near us with his huge family. So instead of running our card she took their drink order, gave them their drinks, then took their food order... brought out their appetizer AND THEN RAN MY CARD. Shoot!!! took us close to 30 minutes just to receive our check, pay, and leave. Totally unacceptable, we will not be going back here :( The food was not that great, and the service was bad, not how i like spending my friday night.", "business_id": "ILsZjIibFtGHMDELeX610Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-01-15", "type": "review"},

Chang\"s and it was very satisfying. Went for lunch on a Friday and it was not very busy at all.\n\nI\"ll get into the food in a bit, but first I have to applaud Chang\"s for their amazing service. Not only were they super-attentive and friendly but they helped us out so much. The thing is, my girlfriend is vegetarian and I am vegan so it\"s often hard to find a decent meal at restaurants that cater primarily to meat-eaters. We let our server know our dietary concerns and he was zipping back and forth to the kitchen (unbidden, mind you!) to find out what all was vegan. Usually when I dine out and ask "Does this have _____ in it?" or "Is this vegan?" I get an odd look and an unsure "Yeah...that\"s totally vegan...". It\"s hard to enjoy a meal when you aren\"t confident that there isn\"t some sort of strange animals bits lurking in it. You\"d have to adhere to understand, but trust me. It sucks when you can\"t enjoy your food because there is that concern in the back of your mind.\n\nNow on to the food...\n\nWe started with the tofu lettuce wraps which I had heard great things about. They were a bit salty for my tastes, but still very good. The addition of a crisp, cool sesame slaw would have taken this dish to the next level, but that\"s just me.\n\nFor the main course I got the coconut curry and my girlfriend got the ma po tofu. The coconut curry had all kinds of colorful vegetables and tofu topped with peanuts. It was alright, but no where near the same quality curry you\"d get from Thai Basil or Swadee or Touch of Thai. But that\"s to be expected. After all, it\"s not a Thai restaurant.\n\nThe ma po tofu was HUGE. Large, sweet and saucy chunks of tofu wreathed in broccoli. Of the three things we tried, this was my favorite.\n\nOh, and they offer brown rice! Thank goodness because American really needs to get on the Whole Grain Train.\n\nSo there you have it. The vegan food is enough for me to *want* to return, but the great service pretty much guarantees that I will. I just hope the Chang\"s across the street from me in Chandler can match this location! If so, I\"d be stunned.\n\nUPDATE: Since posting this review I\"ve visited both the Chandler and Tempe Chan\"gs. Of the three Scottsdale is by far the best. Chandler location completely lost my business when they mixed chicken in with my tofu. Unacceptable.", "business_id": "CycfCC0OLvTjG3Eks8D1og", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-07", "type": "review"},

The chips were great. Loved the dip. But only 1 artichoke head split in 1/2? For over $9 at least put 2 on the plate.\n- Parmesan crusted chicken was $16.95. They stack 2 pieces of chicken on top garlic mashed potatoes & the whole thing is surrounded by sauce with mushrooms & sun dried tomatoes.\n\nDrinks:\n- My friend got a red or black velvet. I think it was red. It was fruity & smokey. Not my style but he liked it. About $5.\n- My other friend got some cherry beer. It was sweet & very cherry flavored. Again, not my style but of course he liked it. About $5.\n- My friends then got some kind of orange beer with added slices of orange. I really liked this 1. Very tasty. They told me it"s from a brewery out in Scottsdale. I remember my friend saying this 1 cost only about $3\n- I drank a pomegranate mojito. It was good & there was plenty of mint. Mojitos make me feel like I"m drinking Listerine or gum. If I remember correctly this was over $8.\n- I also got a margarita. Pretty sour but I always love them like that. \n\nThe music was good. Is there really a jukebox? I didn"t see 1...\n\nOur bartender, Jason was friendly & helpful. He changed the channel for me when I asked. There are tons of tv"s there!

I"ve gone with many friends and family her over the years and they all have been satisfied.\n\nSo it pains me to write a bad review, but the last couple experiences I"ve had at Swadee have required me to bid Swadee adieu.\n\nThe first bad experience I ordered the Larb Tofu. The dish was so salty I couldn"t finish it. It literally tasted like the cap fell off the soy sauce bottle and they dumped  several cups of the stuff in the pan/wok. Even if they didn"t, it was pretty much inedible. Inedible in the same way a salad swimming in vinaigrette is.\n\nThe second occurred during a visit with my girlfriend. We are both vegetarians and took great care to make sure that the dishes we ordered were meat (and fish sauce, and chicken broth) free. Those ingredients can upset a vegetarian"s stomach if it"s been a while since they ate meat (or if they"ve never eaten it). \n\nWell, my girlfriend ordered the pad thai (carefully made veg) and she found a piece of chicken in her dish. To most this would not be a big deal, but to us chicken isn"t considered food and it taints the food it was cooked with. As a result she lost her appetite and it made me feel uneasy about what might be in my own meal. Our lovely Valentine"s Day dinner came to a screeching halt.\n\nAnd as a side note they have a dish with oyster sauce listed on their vegetarian menu. Since when is an oyster a vegetable? The only vegetarian oyster is an oyster mushroom!\n\nI understand that there is always a risk for cross contamination and I expect it when I dine out. But this occurance is far more than just cross contamination. I mean, this thing was a pretty decent sized chunk of bird. It makes me feel uneasy about the level of cross contamination that takes place in Swadee"s kitchen. \n\nThe staff was kind enough to comp the tainted Pad Thai (which accounts for the ** instead of *) but I don"t believe yo"ll see me walking into Swadee any time in the foreseeable future.", "business_id": "vtQOervVVTXjhvSZQiZ6PA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-02-15", "type": "review"},

While the food was close to what I remembered, the service was mediocre at best.\n\nI was trying to remember just why I stopped going, I know a big part was that I found a place I liked even better, but on looking back I realized that I went looking elsewhere because the service gradually went down. I had  bonded with a couple of wait staff who eventually left and it was kind of never the same, so I left, too.\n\nWhich brings me to today. The morning started out well enough with a waitress who promptly took my order with a smile. But then my order was brought by someone else...I asked for salsa and watched as that waitress went into the kitchen and...started...talking...to...other employees. So I waited... and waited...and watched as she continued to talk with a couple of people who seemed to be more hanging around than working. I finally resigned  myself to using the hot sauce on the table. Now, I want to be fair here, I was alone and when you are the only one at the table the food goes fast. I was 3/4 done with my meal when the original waitress came by to see "how my food was tasting". Told her the meal itself was fine but she should know about the salsa incident. She then cryptically said she would find out who it was and left. A few moments later the other waitress came by and apologized for forgetting and wanted to know if I still wanted the salsa without looking at the now empty except for the muffin plate. No thanks.\n\nSo, is that enough to spur me to knock down my initial review? Shouldn"t be except for one other minor point. We"re in the desert with record heat this week and my water glass was never refilled, no one came by and even offered, in fact the check just kind of showed up at the table. Again, the restaurant was busy enough that this could have been an oversight but employees were standing around. In fact, when I went to pay the check, the Manager was hanging out with two of the waitstaff up front and the little bit of conversation I heard didn"t sound work related to me.\n\nIt is so very rare that I skip out on the tip, but my feeling is that when the bill is almost twelve bucks, I could at least be offered a second glass of water. Tipping is a reflection of the service rendered and I wasn"t feeliing to good about that service by the end of the meal.", "business_id": "e5gB2kDFaodtxMTa53C29g", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-08-28", "type": "review"},

The way he described it put me in the mind set I was about to eat a piece of meaty heaven and a cloud like bun. So we went on a Friday night around 6 pm. The place has a nice chill atmosphere. The wait staff is very nice. We started with an appetizer of Pig Wings, which are little ribs on the bone covered in a sweet and spicy peach and hablanero bbq sauce. They were mighty tasty but took at least 20 min to come out.  Like most places in phoenix, they had Four Peaks beers on tap. This is fine with me. So we had a few beers, the ordered our burgers.\n\nI ordered there specialty burger, The Hangover: Fried egg, bacon and a split green chili on it on a pretzel bun. As a side I choose the sweet potato tots. The burger was cook perfect to my order, but lacked seasoning. Even with a green chili on it I didn"t get the heat I was expecting.  The bacon was crispy and the egg was cooked nice. The pretzel bun was excellent. It wasn"t a bad burger but it didn"t have that wow factor I was looking for.  The side of sweet potato tots was great. They even give you a side spicy catsup. This was good, but with sweet potato tots you need to serve them with a maple, or sweet sauce. \n\nSo overall I would go back to give this place a second chance.

I tend to cook at home most nights.  When I\"m in a state that has In-N-Out Burger, though, I make an exception.\n\nTruth be told, I\"ve never thought of In-N-Out Burger as fast food.  It is true diner quality -- which is a compliment.  I\"m talking about the diners of yesteryear.  When diner food was like home cooking, but with a much bigger grill!\n\nI\"ve been to a number of In-N-Out Burger\"s in my day.  Something I appreciate at each location is just how much the staff seems to enjoy their job.  Now, I don\"t have much fast food experience.  I don\"t know what it\"s like at one of the big chains, like McDonald\"s or Burger King -- but I\"ve heard from friends who have worked at one of those places that it is a fairly thankless job.  I\"ve never met a person, sans an owner of a McDonald\"s franchise, who said they loved to work for the golden arches.  But, people who work for In-N-Out Burger are always so...jovial.  It\"s actually quite jarring.  \n\nThis location is no exception.\n\nIt opened at 1030AM.  We were there at 10AM because we were driving into town and figured it would be easier to wait than to drive back at a later time.  At 10AM, they were already helping customers and making orders.  Why? Because they had a line of people and cars that was there before we arrived at 10AM and they want to make their customers happy.  A simple philosophy that seems to be too often forgotten these days.\n\nOf course, everyone seems to know about the secret menu, so I won\"t explain my order to anyone.\n\nWe got:\n\nDouble Double  Animal Style - it was exactly what we hoped it would be.  Flavorful, juicy, well-cooked and delicious!  These burgers really stand the test of time, as well, due to a wonderfully sweet and decently dense bun.\n\nFries Well-Done Animal Style - These fries are a gift from whatever god you believe in. Secret sauce, grilled onions, cheese and deliciously crisp fries make for a mouth-watering experience.\n\nAll in all, a great location that went above and beyond to take care of its customers.  \n\nAs an aside, for us, 1030AM equated to 1230PM since we live in Texas and had just driven into town.  Watching all these college kids eat burgers and fries for breakfast -- well, I wept for my love of pancakes and bacon.\n\nAnother aside, most In-N-Out Burger locations still don\"t know the "On the Sal" secret menu item.  It\"s a side salad with secret sauce (a bit like thousand island but better).

The Lounge has become one of my fave places in the valley. The decor is SOOO mellow. There are tables & chairs, couches, or the bar of course.

Each time i went just beyond sucked.  I would try and order drinks, only to be looked over to the guys behind me, I would play pool and be called a cunt, I would even come as part of the gay dart league, playing against their team for charity, and always always received second-class treatment for my lack of a penis.  The last insult was their institution of the no bags over the size of like a No. 10 envelope. I learned this at the door as I watched guys walking out of the bar wearing backpacks!  I happen to carry a lot of shit around, and will not be the lezbot in cargo shorts!  Needless to say, I had turned down countless offers of meeting there after finally being fed up with all the bullshit. I mean, come ON.  But,  a couple weeks ago, my girls wanted to do a bike and booze, with Charlie"s as one of the spots to hit. I cast my longstanding grudge aside, borrowed my roomie"s little shoulder bag which fell under the acceptable size limits, and pedaled on over with my homies.  And, I"m glad I did. It was a Thursday, their 2-4-1 night, was moderately busy, and I was immediately greeted with a smile by one of their cutie bartenders, was served awesome and well-poured shots, and in general, had a great time. I learned that the lady-hatin guys had all been ditched a while ago, which was great to hear. This is not to say it isn"t biased, and some of the older male clientele threw daggers from their cataract-addled eyes, but f*ckit. It was the first time I"d been there that my money spent the same, and I was treated with respect and encouraged to have a good time. It certainly won"t be a destination spot for me, but I definitely won"t hesitate when invited to swing down and hang with friends.", "business_id": "eFK2QePKvAowH-uX-0V4hQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-09-01", "type": "review"},

It just wasn\"t the Vig I\"m coming to know & love.\n\nWe showed up around 12 or so on April First Friday.\n\nParking is a disaster here too. Hello Shasta. Lots of people park anywhere else BUT the Vig lot. At least you don\"t have to park across the street, just next door.\n\nThe door guy does not really check ID\"s. He just looked at us & waved us in.\n\nThe architecture is cool. It\"s open & the ceiling is tall. It\"s not as cramped. Lots of gray, concrete, rust colored metal, & some wooden accents. So, the inside is ok. Better than the other Vig.\n\nPut up a clear, easy to read sign pointing to where the restrooms are! Do it NOW. Everyone wants to walk back to where the kitchen is. Nope, restrooms are right where the patio starts in the back on the left.\n\nThe patio sucks. It\"s more like an extension of the inside. Not as lounge-like as the other Vig. It\"s closed in with tons of glass & block. It\"s freaking LOUD out there. Everything reverberates. Not good. Only awesome thing is the fireplace. More people can sit around it & it\"s really cool looking.\n\nThe servers pay attention to you here! Are there more of them at this location? I saw our server tons of times & she checked on us at least 5 times, maybe more. That\"s great!\n\nI ordered a grilled cheese sandwich. I didn\"t know you could mess 1 of those up. The bread is HUGE & fluffy. I could barely taste the cheese past all that bread. Saving part about that meal are their fries.\n\n- Moscow Mule was yum :)\n- Glass of Next: Pinot Nior was very good.\n- Trout Slayer on tap! My friend has property in Missoula Montana & was a little surprised it was on tap here. This was my first time trying it. I don\"t normally like beer. I\"m picky with beer. This stuff is GOOD!

Since 1998, I"ve been in and out through Sky Harbor because I use to work in Phoenix.  Back in the day, this airport was one of the better airports around (i.e. free wifi, clean, big, easy, stress-free, etc).  I think this airport could use additional terminals and gates.  Even though this airport looks like Vegas" McCarran, it"s nowhere near as stress-free as them. Sky Harbor is known for their layovers and this means a ton of inside traffic.  This airport is so busy that all you hear is people, beep beep from the golf carts, and a ton of intercom messages from flights being delayed, cancelled, etc.  Try taking a nap at Sky Harbor, ain"t happening. Try finding somewhere to sit while you wait for your plane, good luck with that. \n\nAnother issue with the fact that this is an airport that has a ton of layovers is the travel between gates.  Usually layovers are around an hour which seems like plenty of time, but calculate the half hour early boarding time, rest room break, quick snack, and no concourse.  This leaves you rushing to your gate and hating life. I guess that I never noticed these issues in the past because Phoenix was my destination.  \n\nThere are some pros to this place like free hi-speed wifi, plenty of snack kiosks, and all the phone charging stations.", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-03-07", "type": "review"},

Cafe Krishna stands virtually alone in the Phoenix as the only vegetarian restaurant that fails to offer this.\n\nThis wouldn\"t be an issue if servers were more willing to ensure that products were dairy free. Getting a confirmation that a menu items are dairy-free from the servers feels like pulling teeth, and I making people\"s lives more difficult makes me feel uncomfortable. I just want to sit down and eat with no worries. \n\nA simple "V" next to all the vegan items would make me feel more inclined to eat at Cafe Krishna, it would make me feel more certain about what I was eating, and it would make the lives for the servers easier not having to run back and forth the kitchen every time I (and every other vegan) have a question about dairy in my food.\n\nThat aside, the food at Krishna can be quite good. I\"ve had crispy, spicy gobi manchurian here and I\"ve had mild, crumbly gobi manchurian. The rasam and sambar is always good. And the dosas are usually a pretty safe bet. I had my first experience with uttapam here, and it was quite good but I\"ll be sure to ask for no raita next time! \n\nSo, Cafe Krishna, mark the vegan items, and work on a little consistency and you could easily outscore any other Indian join in town.", "business_id": "PLLM4iCYy_OrT-53IZ88Qw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-08-26", "type": "review"},

I asked for a drink recommendation. He asked what flavors I like. I told him I like fruity but not overly sweet. He recommended a drink to me that was very similar to what I\"ve ordered before. His was great though. He had me pegged, spot on.\n\nOnly thing that was bummer is MGD is NOT a drink special on Mon. That\"s a misprint :(\n\n-- The second time was very different. Came in on Fri around 8-9ish. Got a booth & ordered food.\n\nI had the Seafood Pasta which was a special for $12.99 if I remember correctly. Olive Garden has a dish that\"s similar (& usually better). It wasn\"t humongous. I managed to finish it all & not feel stuffed. The seafood part was delicious. The shrimp, mussels, clams were all tasty. There was one clam that didn\"t open. Why was it put on my plate? The sauce was lacking though. It was some kind of oily white wine sauce.

I originally gave Zoe\"s 3 stars, but on my third visit I ended up having one of the worst dining experiences of my life. I\"m typically not a person that will completely write off a restaurant based on one bad experience but I think sometimes it is completely understandable.\n\nI\"ll start off by saying on all 3 of my Zoe\"s experiences I ordered the grilled vegetable kebabs. Not bad, but they are not great. And extremely overpriced, to boot. The item is marked "vegan", but the salad it comes with is topped with feta cheese, which makes it not vegan. Zoe\"s needs to take their "V" off this item because if it wasn\"t for the fact that I emailed Zoe\"s corporate email prior to my first visit, I would have been stuck with an inedible salad. Besides, vegans are smart enough to ask questions about menu items that are not clearly marked vegan. Just don\"t give them false security by labeling non-vegan food "vegan" because then we\"ll feel we don\"t need to ask questions. \n\nIn short, what happened last experience was I ordered "grilled vegetable kebabs" and ended up with a plate of big, stinking, chicken kebabs. A sight not pleasing to most vegans and vegetarians and frankly, quite offensive to ethical vegans and vegetarians. It\"s not a "choice" for me, it\"s a belief and a lifestyle. This is the equivalent to serving a steak to a Hindu, or a rack of ribs to a Jew.\n\nAnyways, server takes my beans off the plate and takes the plate back to get me my kebabs. Mind you, the chicken kebabs cost more than the vegetable ones but I figured getting my money back would be more hassle than it\"s worth. 15 minutes pass. My beans go cold as I patiently wait the return of my food and pita for which to eat said beans. In a flurry of apologies and napkins, my server arrives with my plate. By this point I\"ve already decided I\"m not coming back here ever again. But the cherry on top is there are little bits of feta cheese in my salad. \n\nDone and done.

I\"m a vegetarian and as such I accept that my dining options are not as vast as those with unrestricted diets. However, Asian cuisine is generally very veg friendly and as such I dine at Asian restaurants probably more than any other type of restaurant. Unfortunately, Republic Ramen falls a touch short of what I\"d call "Veg Friendly". The only option you\"ll have is the Vegetarian Ramen, which is OK because that is what I came in there for. And while the ramen was good (very rich, salty and tons of toppings) one dining option is not enough to make me a regular. It would be nice to try, say some udon noodles or an appetizer that isn\"t edamame.\n\nAgain, the ramen is good. And the price is fair.

I was taken here on a first date. It was great!\n2. I\"m an animal lover. I respect animals for actually having unappreciated intelligence. I hear horses remember people who treat them well.\n3. I don\"t care about poop 1 way or another. I can say that I\"d rather deal with horse poop than human poop though! It\"s just digested grass. Humans eat all sorts of processed foods. Now that\"s gross.\n\nAlrighty, let\"s get to it.\n\n$30 for an hour. Not bad, not bad.\n\nThis place helped me realize I don\"t feel like a beginner anymore. I took beginner lessons for a few years every summer in my pre tween years. I was worried I\"d forgotten everything. I haven\"t! Going here brought back a lot of my lessons. They don\"t teach a darn thing here. They help you up on your horse & demonstrate, "Left to go left, right to go right." They tell you to get after your horse for trying to eat along the way too.\n\nI\"m tired of constantly "walking" my horse. There was no trotting of any kind. I practically pleaded to just go a teensy bit faster. Nope, didn\"t happen.\n\nI actually own boots. Everyone else has tennis shoes on. Lots of out of towners come here to try out riding a horse.\n\nI got snapped at because I was going to walk around the back of my horse. I\"m not dumb, I KNOW I\"m supposed to let the horse know I\"m there by keeping my hand on him all the way around. Again, no quick teaching here at all. They don\"t ask you questions to determine your knowledge when you sign the waiver.\n\nI know they have to take precautions because of all the people who have never been on a horse before, but I don\"t need babying. I could get my butt in & out of a saddle when I was 11, on my own. I can certainly do it now.\n\nI did really enjoy this, I\"m just frustrated by feeling held back.\n\nThe guides kind of give you flora & fauna info along the way. The people working here are nice. I just couldn\"t help but chuckle while thinking my grandmother would blow this kid out of the water with the plethora of information she knows.\n\nYou can volunteer here & maybe eventually work your way to having a job!

We finally tried it this morning. I am going to have a hard time being convinced to go back.\n\nWe started with high hopes that immediately got dashed at the door. Although the restaurant was about one third empty the hostess had a bit of hesitancy seating us and then put us at the one table directly in the traffic route to the bathroom. I asked to be seated citing the traffic and again she seemed hesitant as to where to put us (any of the other 10 or so empty tables would have been just fine) before seating us near the front door.\n\nThe waitress came promptly enough for our drink order. J. asked for water to start and I requested coffee.  She came back a few minutes later with 2 waters and no coffee, dropped them off very fast and took off, I assumed to grab the missing coffee...and then the wait began. I started on the water and was a little surprised that it had the distinctive Phoenix tap taste to it. After several minutes of watching the other diners get their coffee refilled J. finally and politely asked if his wife could get the coffee she ordered. The waitress responded with a very tart and sharp "sure" and the coffee I ordered upon walking in was served with our meal.\n\nSo, at this point I bet you are wondering about the meal...it\"s pretty hard to screw up bacon and eggs so that is what I usually order my first visit to a breakfast place (and I just plain like bacon and eggs). The plate arrived looking good with half the plate loaded with their signature rosemary potatoes and an english muffin. I opened my english muffin to find it warm but untoasted (yech) and sent it back...again, no apology or sympathy from the waitress, just that same smart "sure". As I was waiting I started on the potatoes to find that the rosemary was non existent and to be honest, at 9:30 in the morning tasted to me like they were cooked much earlier and kept warm. My english muffin at this point came back toasted so that I could enjoy that.\n\nAt no point did the waitress come back to offer to refill my coffee. Now I don\"t know about you, but I have certain expectations when I\"m spending 10 bucks on breakfast. They\"re simple but consistent. Bring my coffee promptly. When a mistake is made, acknowledge it and make it right and especially if multiple mistakes, apologize. And, when all of that is not accomplished, don\"t try to upsell by offering a pancake for dessert.\n\nThis is truly a bummer because it is the closest real breakfast joint to my house and I was really wanting someone great to come in and earn my business....goodbye bycycling to Sunday morning goodness, I\"ll just continue to get in the car and drive farther for my Weekend morning fare.", "business_id": "pqkwR2me0LhEZulRcQpOuw", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-07-24", "type": "review"},

These miniature cakes seem easy to execute, but I"ve been to cupcake joints all around the world that have led me to beg to differ!\n\nI first found out about Tammie Coe from the 4410 N 40th St location review on Yelp.  It was the closest location to where I was -- and I was searching for the best cupcakes around!  After reading reviews that said the Roosevelt St location was better, I decided to try both.\n\nI had the 4410 N 40th St location cupcakes first.\n\nThis Tammie Coe location has the same cupcakes as the first one -- Red Velvet, Ooey Gooey and Coconut.  I did not try the Coconut because I"m just not a fan in general.\n\nOoey Gooey -- As opposed to the sugar crystal covered cupcake at the 40th St location, this Tammie Coe colored their frosting and gifts you with adorable design aesthetic.  I wondered why they differed, so I asked the gentleman behind the counter. He said it just depended on the day.  This Ooey Gooey was far superior to the one I tried at the 40th St location.  It was moist, sweet -- but not too sweet.  The icing was fresh, sweet with a tad of salt to add a delicious dynamic to a normally mundane cupcake combination.  I remember eating the Ooey Gooey with its chocolate cake and wondering why Tammie Coe offered so little variety.  The lack of sugar crystals made this icing much more enjoyable.  \n\nRed Velvet -- I can honestly say that this is the best Red Velvet cupcake I"ve found in my travels so far.  I"m continually impressed with its quality.  Again, I believe Tammie Coe uses a form of vanilla cake for this cupcake which means it"s not a true Red Velvet.  And again, who cares!  This cupcake melts in your mouth.  The icing is divine.  And with this flavor combination, the sugar crystals really add a depth of flavor and textural dimension, which is far different from my experience with the 40th St Ooey Gooey.\n\nService at this location was far superior to the 40th St location.  They offered us water before taking our cupcakes to go, which I thought was a wonderful touch.\n\nSo, they gave me the BEST Red Velvet I"ve had in my travels.  Why didn"t I give them 5 stars?\n\nMy biggest complaint of this location (as well as the 40th St location) is their lack of variety.  I"d love to see them tackle something more complex or unique.  While Ooey Gooey has a cute name, it"s just a black and white with fun colors.  \n\nAll in all, go here and get the Red Velvet.  It is the best I"ve had.  Just don"t be surprised if you are disappointed at everything else they have to offer (or, in this case, fail to offer).", "business_id": "iqLVYrsX25XUZqjRjvbYfg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-25", "type": "review"},

I really didn\"t want to order close to $20 worth of food to get delivered, but as I perused our folder full of menus that had delivery service, I started to salivate when I started reading the Z Pizza menu. It\"s a very colorful, attractive menu, and had a bright yellow sticker that said "free delivery" (as opposed to Mamma Mia, whom I love, but $2 delivery and $10 minimum, well, anyway, I\"m digressing).  What to get, what to get, it sucks when you\"re just that hungry and all these pretty combinations of toppings jump out at you saying, \"pick me,\" Little tomatoes with white gloves were high kicking like Rockettes with their arms linked with Mr. Mozzarella and his top hat and monocle. Wait, that was Mr. Peanut, anyway...So I decided on the Provence, which was described as having artichokes, tomatoes, capers and garlic sauce, in addition to the mozzarella and regular tomato sauce. I love me some capers.  It seemed a queer combination, but I love all these ingredients and was eager to have a little adventure. I called in my order, and the girl on the phone recognized me from the bar, and we chatted about the pizza, decided I should have a little truffle oil thrown on there as well. What arrived, still hot, and perfectly baked, was one of the tastiest pizzas I\"ve had delivered in a while. The crust was so crunchy and the truffle oil had soaked into it, so it was like its own separate hors d\"ouevre after I made my way to what I would normally call the pizza butt.  The toppings were tasty, fresh, and the combination was truly a treat. I don\"t know about the garlic sauce, it was a bit too much, but maybe in a lesser quantity the flavor would have melded and not been so obtrusive. I was a happy Kitty, and the next day, it reheated like a champ for a little lunch revisited. Good stuff, that Z Pizza.

When I was there they had an average of about 400 students from 6-12th grade.\n\nMorning classes (7:45am - 12:15pm) are normal academics. Performing arts are in the afternoon till 2-3pm depending on the classes. \n\nFor middle school:\nPiano is a required class during the morning.\nPerforming arts options are voice & an instrument (this includes strings I believe), OR ballet (offered off campus with transportation by the school).\nGuitar is available after 6th grade.\nJazz band & percussion ensemble is available by audition only after 6th grade.\nDrama is more of an after school program & has a fee. \n\nFor high school:\nStudents choose 2-3 classes from music (instrument, voice or piano), OR drama, OR ballet.\n\nTo get in there was a waiting list. Or was it first come first serve? Either way, be sure to put your kids name down or be there when they first open with all the necessary paper work. The slots are limited. Remember, the school is SMALL!\n\nI hear they are trying to remodel & expand. When I went there the school rented space from the church, but is in no way affiliated religiously. Other space was across the street. Yes, you cross the street back & forth to get from 1 class to the next. They even had the rule, "No hugging in the crosswalk." That says something about the students lol\n\nConcerts were held in Pilgrim Hall or the actual church. Pilgrim Hall is where lunch can be eaten or a band class is held in the afternoon. Other students eat in the courtyard. A lunch truck (roach coach) came so students could purchase a lunch if they didn\"t bring their own.\n\nThis school had a high turn over of teachers. Every year about 25% of the faculty would either be fired or quit. That\"s actually a lot of teachers. This may not be the case anymore since the school officials have changed. There are teachers still teaching that I recognize from when I went there:\n- Leah Fregulia-Roberts (Head of School) used to be the pricipal\n- Brian Hawkins (11th & 12th Grade Math)\n- Kyle Kirkman (7th & 8th Grade Math) taught me\n- Diane Legge (5th Grade Piano) taught me piano when there was no 5th grade\n- Kristin Mailhiot (Vice-Principal) used to be a middle school science teacher\n\nStudents who either go to this school during HS or graduate stay involved. I would know, I\"m friends with a lot of them on Facebook. They stay arts oriented a lot of the time & still talk about things currently going on at ASA.\n\nSo, why did I leave? There are a few reasons.\n- I wanted a big HS experience.\n- I wanted to go to school with more than 400 students.\n- I wanted life lessons. I didn\"t want to be sheltered. I wanted to see how the real world worked.\n- I wanted to go to a school where there was more than 2 guys to every 10 girls. And where those guys weren\"t gay. Nothing wrong with being gay. But I like boys, gay boys aren\"t interested in girls. See where I\"m going with this?\n- I wanted to get away from the 5 hours of homework every night. I was constantly exhausted. I was 11, 12, & 13. I was still a kid. I missed my time to play... & sleep.\n- I wanted to get away from teachers who taught opinions instead of facts. Yes, this happened. Yes, I told him he was wrong for doing so. Yes, he hated me for it.\n- I hated playing an instrument. I didn\"t have time to practice after all that homework. I can\"t sing. Anything I was interested in wasn\"t available till a later year. Blah blah blah... I\"m not creative. Honestly, I\"m not.\n- I wanted more options. Different types of friends. Maybe to go to school with more than 95% white kids.\n\nWhat did I like?\n- I kept friends I made in middle school to this very day.\n- The teachers are smart & actually make friends with their students.\n- I usually loved the required summer reading choices.\n- I love how close the Burton Barr library is. Spent almost every day after school there. I knew people who worked there & am still friends with them.", "business_id": "Z9GH9bo8SHKx3oOokhHLyw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-04-07", "type": "review"},

The menu is indeed enormous, and the walls are covered with even more meal options.  They offer everything from fairly pedestrian Americanized Chinese food (lo mein, orange chicken, rice bowls) to authentic Hong Kong-style menu options.\n\nPortions are plentiful and many dishes are seriously budget-priced - you can get a rice bowl for about $4.  My favorite dishes are tofu with black mushrooms and the veggie chow fun.  \n\nNext time you\"re in the mood for Chinese, skip the buffet and come here for your fix - you\"ll get much better quality food for your money.", "business_id": "XMRj865sZBPWCI7tx0uBWw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-11-30", "type": "review"},

I say, ok, I summoned Barry Gibb for a minute.  I absolutely LOVE this place! Went for dinner with some friends to check it out and I"m thoroughly impressed. We each ordered a different drink: Michelada, Margarita, and White Sangria.  The spicy salt rim on the Michelada just rocked. Very refreshing in this summer heat. The sangria was well balanced and not overly sweet, and the Margarita was tits on... Starting with the corn, rolled in delicious cotija cheese and smoked paprika, we were wishing there were more than one cob, but managed to share nicely...Then the guacamole: Fresh, savory, and an ample portion to dip our freshly made tortilla strips... And since there were just the 3 of us, we ordered 3 of each of their tacos. Pork, Beef and Fish.  Everything marinated in its own unique sauce and perfectly tender, seasoned, just exquisite.  Great atmosphere, unpretentious, wonderful attention to detail both in ingredients and plating, and extremely reasonable prices. It"s become my favorite place to pop in, if just to grab some of that amazing guac or a couple tacos to go...maybe a Michelada to take by the pool...If I can manage to wake up early enough, I"m very much looking forward to trying the breakfast..", "business_id": "-sC66z4SO3tR7nFCjfQwuQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-07-07", "type": "review"},

A lot more than just tofu! I go here at least a couple times a month for lunch and it\"s spectacular 95% of the time. A few of our favorite items are the BBQ "Chicken" sandwich, Thee Argentine sandwich, the crab puffs and of course, the Tsoynamis. Everything is fairly priced ($8 for a sandwich, $7.50 for a bowl w/ your choice or rice or noodles). The only thing I don\"t particularly care for is the buffalo wings as I think they are far too salty. The ranch that it comes with is fantastic, though. Also, if you get something with cheese make sure to use Daiya instead of Teese. Daiya tastes much better, in my opinion.\n\nThe atmosphere is very artsy. There are always paintings for sale and there are a bunch of old car doors and hub caps over to one side. They just got a few booths which is fantastic if you want a little privacy. There is free wifi, a booshelf will all sorts of great reading, and the staff is always super friendly.\n\nAnother great thing about Green is the vegan market. They have all sorts of great vegan foods and books for you to spoil yourself with. It\"s the only place I know of where you can find Teese, Food for Lovers Queso and Soy Curls. As an aside, I highly recommend Soy Curls as a healthy replacement to the meat in your fajitas or cheesesteaks.\n\nAnother thing you absolutely must check out is their annual ThanksLIVING festival on Thanksgiving. They will load you up will all sorts of delicious and traditional Thankgsiving day food, veganized. "Turkey", stuffing, biscuits, brussels sprouts, asparagus, cranberry sauce, gravy, corn, pie and a drink. You\"ll get guest speakers, live music and local arts and crafts.

It"s amazing how a little thing like sliced garlic makes a huge difference in flavor balance.\n\nI thought I"d had some darn good horchata before. This is horchata on steroids.

Because it wasn\"t a 3 for me, but I hate to go all the way down to a 2 on this.\n\nI should love this restaurant. It\"s at an airport...I love airports. It\"s biking distance from my home...I love super close. It\"s a local business and God knows I love to support local businesses. It has great reviews on YELP and I really trust my Yelp buddies.\n\n...fast forward to my breakfast there today. We were greeted by a very pleasant hostess who immediately seated us next to the window where we could watch the planes and assured us that our waiter would be right with us. The restaurant was near empty at about 10:15 on Sunday morning.\n\nOur server was with us immediately. For drinks we ordered two glasses of water and coffee for me. i asked if I might have a lime in my water and the waiter seemed distracted but said yes. And then we waited...and waited...and I joked that it was kind of funny that there were 10 reviews and the lowest was a 3 with a complaint about mediocre service.\n\nJust when it got to the point that I was verbally questioning to J. if it was possible that the 9 stellar reviews could possibly be from friends and family our server showed up with our drink order. 2 miniscule (I believe an 8 oz. Libby style glass) glasses for water filled to the brim with ice and limes on the side, black coffee "oh, and I didn\"t know if you wanted these" half and half individuals.\n\nAt this point he asked to take our meal order. J. got the BLT and I got the basic 2 egg breakfast. I asked what breads there were for the toast option and told white, wheat and 9 grain. it seems like a restaurant that only does breakfast and lunch would have a slightly more varied option than wheat and upgraded wheat. How did I want my eggs? Basted. The waiter looked befuddled and then admitted he didn\"t know what that was. Again, a restaurant that serves egg dishes should have their wait staff trained well enough to not question a standard request and if they really don\"t know what it is tell the kitchen and then google it if it\"s still a problem. (just my humble opinion.)\n\nOur drinks ran dry. We didn\"t see the waiter again until the meals were brought and he asked if there was anything else he could get us. I asked for refills on the drinks, butter and jam for my toast.\n\nIt took just long enough to refill the drinks that I was wondering if I would have to eat my meal dry. When he did bring them, I had to ask for more cream and remind him that I was still waiting for butter and jam. This was finally brought and the butter was frozen (a big pet peeve for me).\n\nNow to be absolutely fair, the food was good. The only complaint I had about it was that it is standard to receive 2 slices of toast and I was served only one and it seemed to be near the end of the loaf as it was extremely small. J. said his sandwich was very good.\n\nSo here\"s my feeling on this place. When a restaurant goes into a location that is off the beaten track and that location has a track record of changing businesses (I believe this is the 3rd restaurant in this location in the 6 1/2 years I\"ve lived near the airpark) then it places a very strong responsibility on the management to make it a WOW experience so that people come back time and time again.There was no WOW today, not even a fizzle and pfft.  I felt absolutely no incentive to come back and kind of feel bad that my trying it in the first place was based on the excited reviews here on Yelp. That was a first for me.\n\nSo how do I rate a restaurant that in theory has everything it needs to be successful but fizzles in practice? I really wanted to give this a 5...it turned upside down to a 2 for me...sorry.", "business_id": "b1rF_Y3xbdPwP_z9NHFMjQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-06-24", "type": "review"},

It wasn"t horrible. It just wasn"t what it was supposed to be. Also, Contigo Peru is tight with their sauces and cancha cerrano. Cancha cerrano is like a toasted corn nut. Usually it is served in place of bread and butter. Our togo order did not include any and she would have charged us for some if we had not complained about the size of the ceviche. They were reluctant about giving usadditional aji verde and the pollo a la brasa sauce they provided for our whole order looked like the same amount needed for a single 1/4 size order, but we did not realize this until we got home. We miss our old place. One thing is for sure, you cannot go wrong with the chicha morada. Love this stuff!!! It is a textured  juice made from simmering purple corn with sugar and seasonings like star anise and cinnamon. This was the best part of our meal :)", "business_id": "2lGaj8WVLetIWsK8B729mw", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-07-10", "type": "review"},

I truly believe they are one of the best treats one can have.\n\nWhen I travel (which is often), I find myself compelled to look for the best cupcake that city has to offer. After scouring Yelp!, I found Tammie Coe. It looked promising, but I found it odd that two locations so relatively close to one another differed in ratings and reviews as drastically as they did. So, I decided it was my civic (and culinary) duty to try cupcakes at both.\n\nThis location has Red Velvet, Ooey Gooey and Coconut available.  I opted against trying the latter because I"m just not a coconut fan.\n\nOoey Gooey -- One thing I enjoy about this cupcake is how jovial it is.  It is pure joy in small cake form.  They come covered in sugar crystals -- in a variety of colors!  This cupcake looked better than it tasted, sadly.  Now, it was good.  But it wasn"t amazing.  The chocolate cake was a bit dry and the icing was somewhat pedestrian.  Perhaps I"ve become too much of a cupcake snob, but I sincerely cannot tell a lie -- when it comes to cupcakes!  Truth be told, I feel this cupcake suffered from being a tad too old -- and kept it far too cold of an environment.\n\nRed Velvet -- This is the cupcake I use as my way to judge all bakers.  This cupcake is a classic.  Now, Tammie puts a spin on this classic that is extremely unique.  Their red velvet is not made with traditional southern chocolate.  It seems they use a vanilla based cake for their red velvet.  While I"m not sure that constitutes this cupcake to be called a red velvet any longer, I will say -- WHO CARES!  Their red velvet in a sweet, vanilla cake with a vanilla cream cheese frosting that is coated in red sugar crystals.  It was moist, flavorful, not overly sweet.  It is a very fine cupcake. Not the best I"ve had -- but it is up there and deserves praise.\n\nOne thing I"d like to point out is that unless you order ahead, you need to buy your cupcakes at La Grange Orange Grocery (or LGO as the locals call it).  The service there was wonderful.  They even let me pick whatever color ooey gooey I wanted.  That being said, when we walked into Tammie Coe (not knowing we had to buy from LGO), we were treated fairly -- cold.  The woman in the bakery looked at us as though we didn"t get the memo.  She spoke to us with great disdain and sent us packing.  It really put me off -- but, I try to just judge the food.  And since you don"t need to deal with that bakery to eat their cupcakes, I"ll just thank my lucky stars!", "business_id": "bsEJKduEgoBhNNNHO4ZHEw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-03-25", "type": "review"},

If every time I was in it was yesterday"s experience, then 5 stars all the way.\n\nHas management changed, perhaps? Service was near perfect, everyone was cheery and my meal was error free. Great JOB!\n\nIf yelp allows revising of reviews, then I will certainly revisit this in a month or two if I see that this is the new constant as opposed to a fluke. Food"s very good, though, so gotta give it a Thumbs Up for that ;-D", "business_id": "Pr9rQKypHgC_J1AfufxzIw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-08-29", "type": "review"},

Add to the name recognition the fact that they accepted our Marriott points, and were "so close to the {University of Phoenix} Stadium you could throw a rock and hit it", and it sounded like a winner. \n\nWell, almost.\n\nThis place was a BITCH to find because (1) the facility is too new to appear on maps and didn\"t show up on the GPS and (2) we took the staff\"s statements literally. Not one, not two, but THREE employees had told me on the phone, prior to my booking the reservation, that this place was "right across the parking lot from the Stadium". They said that a car was optional; that the walking distance was very close, and you could see the stadium from the hotel. So, upon locating the Stadium, (it\"s huge and hard to miss), we drove in circles, trying to spot this elusive hotel. \n\nWe called, and told them that we\"d been told it was right across from the Stadium parking lot. "Yeah, we\"re right here." Huh? We kept circling the frickin place, wondering if this SH was invisible. Called again, and were told enough to get us there, but it turned out to be nowhere near the Stadium. The only hotel near the Stadium was the Renaissance, followed by the Hampton. \n\nObviously we were really ticked off at being misled on the location. WTF is wrong with those people? Can they not judge distance? Are they looking through binoculars? Come on. Yes, technically it\"s walking distance, but a long one. Not comfortably walkable if you have any health issues, are not in athletic footwear, nor have the energy after many hours in the stadium. Certainly NOT "right across the parking lot."  It\"s not even in the nearest shopping center to the Stadium. Thank goodness we had a rental car and had not depended on walking, which we\"d briefly considered based on the information we\"d been given!\n\nIf this is the line they\"re supposed to give out-of-towners who are there to go to the Stadium, it\"s dead wrong and should be changed. \n\nOn to the hotel itself...\n\nThe building is new, and it shows. Everything\"s beautiful, especially the courtyard, which is shared with Residence Inn. There\"s a big fountain which provided great photo ops. Very pretty. The gentleman who checked us in even obliged us some picture-taking so we could get in the shot with our friends. Cool! \n\nThe room itself had a wonderful layout. The living/office area was semi-walled off from the sleeping area, so someone could go to bed and not be disturbed by someone staying up. The bathroom was totally decent, with an added feature of a built-in shelf raised off the counter so I could set toiletries and hair/makeup tools out without being cramped. Great idea! The tub was very shallow, and the granite installation was clearly cheap. Would rather have an acrylic surround done properly than look at ugly cracks. But, whatever. \n\nThere was a flat TV sitting on the dresser that could be angled to view either from bed or from the desk/chairs -- nice touch. \n\nThe pool was an impressive size (but we didn\"t use it -- too cold at the 7 a.m. hour), as was the hot tub. Unfortunately the hot tub suffered from misfiring jets. All they did was make a mess. I think it\"s got to be a Marriott affliction, because the Residence we stayed in earlier this year had the same problem to a much worse degree. Get a real contractor to build those things, I know they\"re out there! No excuse. It was also so over-chlorinated that our eyes stung and noses wrinkled just to get near it. SUCH a waste of time, even though we only spent about a minute in there. We never saw anyone else use the hot tub or pool in three days.\n\nThe buffet breakfast was well-stocked and things were cooked well. The only omission? Potatoes. They had cereals, pastries, bread, yogurt, milk, juices, coffee, tea, cocoa, ready-made cheese/egg omelettes, eggs, sausage patties, English muffins, fruit, and an employee on hand to help. We were overall quite satisfied with the breakfast. \n\nThe beds were really comfortable, with lots of great pillows. It\"s nice to stay in a facility that\"s so new, it hasn\"t had a chance to get gross yet! The toilet paper was cheap and scratchy, but I\"m used to that at Marriotts, so I brought our own. The hair conditioner in the room was half used. When we called for more, it was brought to us no problem.\n\nCan\"t imagine that we\"d stay here again, as we had a pretty singular reason to need to be so close to the Stadium, but we\"d recommend it to others with the warning not to believe anyone who says it\"s right across the parking lot from the Stadium. If you\"re not parking at the Stadium, be prepared for a walk. Considering how exhausted I was after the show, there\"s NO WAY I could have handled a walk like that.", "business_id": "z6Od24xDBD9IoEWDfpRNNg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-10-24", "type": "review"},

Their pot stickers are some of my families favorites, pair that with the vegetable fried rice and orange chicken.. you have yourself a meal in under 20 minutes, and there are no preservatives or weird ingredients! I will continue to shop here for my hippie loving food, we are loyal customers and so glad there is a Trader Joe"s in our city :)", "business_id": "m4Vdae9cdx7bgr6bIjjbkw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-03-26", "type": "review"},

Includes pico de gallo and our custom cheese blend." Ok now that I read it the next day it doesn\"t sound that amazing, so maybe I was just hungry... It did taste wonderful though! The portions weren\"t too crazy and the homemade tortilla chips that accompanied it went very well with the hot salsa. \n\nSo apparently this place also makes a few different types of fresh lemonade.

They don"t really talk to you or even look up much unless you get their attention.\n\nMy friend asked if they had cassette tapes. The girl at the front said they have a very small selection. Pretty much nothing my friend would be interested in anyway probably. Way to sell it there lol\n\nI asked if they even had a restroom. The whole place is itty bitty. She pointed to it while saying it was pretty gross. Was it really gross, or did she just not want me to use it? I didn"t push the door open to check.\n\nI got my feel for the place. Why would I need to come back here?", "business_id": "Re0Xw-AYkn6NK7QRk3kPEg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-03-25", "type": "review"},

But when you look at how horrible people dress in our fine state, then you know why this Barneys doesn"t carry Rick Owens, or Junya Watanabe like their other locations.  \n\nYes, the selection is lacking, but the menswear selection is the best in the whole state.  It is wonderful edited with simple, classic, modern essentials.  The most eccentric designer they carry on the men"s floor is Etro, and that is conservative compared to what the L.A. or NYC locations carry.  If yo"re looking for jeans, they have a wonderful selection ranging from A.P.C., Nudie, to your basic AG"s and Levi"s (the made in U.S.A. line).  Their shoe selection is small but edited.  They carry Harry"s of London, Crockett & Jones, to Lanvin sneakers.  The suiting area is a bit of a disappoint.  The used to carry Kiton and Isai, but at least they still have Etro, Armani Collezioni, and their private brand (made by Canali).  Niemen"s suiting selection is better, but Barney"s is still able to compete.  Their dress shirts and tie selection is the best I have seen.  I know of no one else carrying Duchamp or Richard James ties.  I was ecstatic when I saw this location carried Guy Rover dress shirts.  They also have Isai shirts and ties (as of 3 months ago at least).  \n\nIn conclusion, though Barney"s may be small, the selection is wonderfully edited.

The visuals look as though there was no thought or effort put into them whatsoever; and today, the service I received while shopping with my mother was atrocious.\nWe found some great deals, made our way over to the registers, and stood there, waiting; just waiting for one of the four associates (two of which I"m positive were managers or leads of some sort) to notice and assist us. There were no other customers. I had to loudly announce our presence; and when a teenage girl finally did meander her way over to us, she was rude and inattentive. \nSo sad to see such a great company give such a horrible experience.
