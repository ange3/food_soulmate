This is probably the best buffet I've ever had of any type of food, and possibly the best Indian food I've ever had in my life.  I live in Tucson where there are a couple adequate Indian places, but nothing to rival this.  I think I would even drive to this place from Tucson if I had enough of a craving for Indian food and a free evening.  AMAZING food, service, etc.  I've had tons of Indian food all over the country, Northern and Southern style; this place is one of the best ever!", "business_id": "aPdDcFXPsWVxBhaXuZcDpw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-27", "type": "review"}]
