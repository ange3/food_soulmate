I remembered the curries and stir-fry dishes were ok but nothing really memorable.  A quick summary for my latest visit:\n\nPros:\n- convenient order-at-the counter setup\n- self-serve drink station\n- brown and white rice mixture\n- friendly and gracious owners\n\nCons:\n- too much napa cabbage in comparison to green vegetables \n- wish the owner/chef would be back in the kitchen vs. managing\n- spice level on the weak side", "type": "review", "business_id": "WIcDFpHEnC3ihNmS7-6-ZA"},

Granted, it wasn't as bad as it could have been, but in my opinion, it was unacceptable.\n\nFor one thing, there was six or seven rats packed in one cage that was, what . . . \n1' x 9\", 1 x 8\"? Don't quote me on that - I'm not 100% sure, but regardless of the details, it was way too small for the number of rats that were in it. They weren't unhealthy; they didn't look very sick, but they definitely didn't look particularly healthy, either. \n\nThe guinea pigs were what really shocked me, though. If you know anything about guinea pigs, you'll know they need a lot of space - even just for one. This cage was the same size as the rat's cage (they all were). They barely had enough to room to walk, much less exercise or popcorn (which my guinea pigs do often). There were two guinea pigs packed in that thing, when it was way, way too small for one baby guinea pig. It also didn't look that clean - all the cages, in my opinion, were grungy. The whole place felt grungy and grimy. And they obviously weren't cleaning the cages everyday, which they should be doing. It would be more unfair to the animals to do anything but at least a small cleaning each day.\n\nThe prices are, indeed, pretty good, or at least better than the prices at the Petsmart I usually go to, so there's one point for Petco. \n\nAt last, the employees. Are they nice and cheerful? Yes. That is, until you politely point out that the guinea pig cage is way too small for them to be healthy and happy (I was trying my hardest to be polite, although I could have come across as rude), they (or the one I talked to) immediately turn defensive, telling you \"it's very temporary\" and \"we take them out every night\" (which I don't believe, but maybe a Petco employee can correct me on that?) and make a face at you, not once telling you they'll tell their manager (even if they won't) or you may be right, like a good employee would.\n\nWant your customers to come back? Here's a good tip: don't tell them they're wrong about something, and rudely correct them, obviously trying to rush them out. Humor them, even if they are wrong about something.\n\nOverall, I would recommend not shopping here. They don't take good care of their pets, and their employees are rude if you care about the animals when they plainly don't. Good prices? They don't make up for that.\n\nI apologize if I made this too long, and thank you if you read all of this, regardless of whether or not you agree with me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oqr6xovYM2BRrLojaO26Dg"},

Not...\n\nA group of eight of us show up tonight for \"dinner\" and drinks.  We get seated way the hell in the back.  I guess we didn't fit in with the rest of the crowd.  Two graphic designers, three filmmakers, a photographer and some friends.. ok?  The reason I point this out is that the waiter lets us know that this place isn't that classy of a place like LeBoca, so the people are.. well... less classy? The guy was digging himself a hole.\n\nSo we order drinks, which seem to take about 10minutes to get to our table.  In the mean time we're looking at our menu and the waiter leaves again for about 10min... he finally shows up and we order from this tiny little menu.   My girlfriend and I order some tacos and chips with guacamole, everyone else orders something a bit similar.  \n\nConversation is picking up while we wait for our food.  I see people coming and going and that's when we notice that our food is taking too damn long.  Finally after eating our small plate of chips and guacamole our food arrives. Probably about 45min later.  Here's the best part....\n\nSo the food shows up and after waiting for 45minutes, we get these tiny little tacos that look like they are from the menu of a 2 year old.  That's right.. each of the three tacos are literally two bites at most each.  Everyone eats their dinner in about 5minutes max..  pathetic.\n\nAfter our tiny little dinner, we ask for our bills..The waiter doesn't think to bring all our bills at once, no.. instead he brings one or two at a time. Guess he wants us to stick around? Who knows.. Finally the two filmmakers get their bill, pay and they leave.. couple other of our friends do the same.  My friend and I stay with our other friend who's still waiting on his bill.  He gets it and notices that his $15 meal was just charged $30 on his credit card.  He complains and the waiter vanishes for about 20minutes to fix his card.  When he comes back he gives some crap about fixing it and giving him a credit.. guess how much? Oh about 50 cents.. \n\nHe signed the slip and the remaining three of us left this crappy place.\n\nThe place actually does look pretty cool.

I am not sure if this was because the sign was not lit up or what. But, they are just 2 weeks old and maybe that hasn't been done or something. Just we aware that the sign might not be lit up when you go.\n\nVenue: It is actually kind of neat inside. There didn't seem to be any \"prime tables\" as all the tables were pretty much just 4-tops. Also, not a lot of seclusion if you are looking for that. About 40% of the venue is a bar, but isn't separated from the restaurant. Real sleek, suave bar. The kitchen is open. So, if the cook is spitting in your food then you will probably see them. I kind of liked having the open kitchen in a small venue.\n\nFood: I had the Green Chili Stew with macaroni and cheese. Go ahead, laugh at my mac & cheese. The green chili was a touch spicy but then again, I am a total spice sissy. Even with that said, it *was* good. I ate it all. \n\nThe mac and cheese was a different story. I jokingly ordered that right off the bat and our server raved about it. Said he loved it. My guest also ordered it. Without a doubt, the mac and cheese was awesome. Really, I think it was better than my green chili stew.\n\nCost: It cost us $48 for two people. This was with 2 mains, 2 sides, an iced-tea, and an alcoholic beverage. Not bad.\n\nBottom Line: I see this place succeeding... especially if people can find it with their light off outside.", "type": "review", "business_id": "I4bSn5gXsHuSPu7L-d_8nQ"},

It was significantly smaller than the sandwich places I normally go to. So I ignored the size and dove in. WOW! The bread was so good. Toasted without being dry, light. The meat was perfectly cooked, not chewy like the last sandwich I ordered at another place, the coleslaw was so good and flavorful, juicy without dripping all over the place. The chips were also really good! Now the sandwich was smaller than I am used to but it wound up being the perfect size. It was so good I can't wait to go back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "yA9gOueRPoQ4-Y8Xdu8k3Q"},

Fortunately, it was under an extended warranty and the repairs were covered. The Geek Squad was courteous in assessing the damage and getting the computer shipped out for repairs, plus informed me about ordering a recovery disc from Sony. \n\nWhen I went to pick up the computer, the staff were thorough about verifying my identity and validity of picking up the computer (the service contract is in Robert M's name).

Brand new state of the art facility, so I'm assuming thats what your paying for at the ticket counter. A bit pricey if you ask me but the gift shop was actually reasonable so thats a wash in my book.....\n\nWe were just in time to catch a 3D documentary on the flight & life of a monarch butterfly. I've seen this before on the tele but it was pretty cool in 3D. Then from there we went into this staging room before the atrium were we got to see several different types of butterflies emerging from their cocoons. Pretty cool! This place is great because there is no rush, it's all at your own speed. After watching butterflies break out of their cocoons we were off to the atrium. a butterfly haven. NO TOUCHING, NO PICKING UP but if they land on you thats ok. Hard for a little girl to grasp so I had to keep reminding her. Trust me when I say the butterfly keepers are on it too! The only thing I don't like about this experience is Summer, it was nice and toasty in there and the humidity was off the charts. From there tho you can cool down in the snack shop before you continue on.....\n\nThe next area is about insects & fish. Really good displays of both & a shallow tank with sting rays in them for petting. Not as spectacle as sea world but worth saving yourself a 5 hour drive over. You make your way thru the gift shop and after that your at the entrance/exit, round 2-sure, there's no time limit, how great! \n\nMy recommendations is try enjoying this place in better weather, you'll get your monies worth for sure being able to stay longer.

Plate lunch is a term that us locals like to call our plates from a bbq or local eatery. A normal plate that you can get from ONO Hawaiian BBQ, L&L BBQ, or any other hawaiian places is that every entree comes with rice and mac salad. But Korean style plate lunches come with rice and 4 sides like mac salad, kimchee, cucumber kimchee, noodles, corn, salad, and seaweed plus a few other choices. Thas the key difference and so far this is the only place I have found this.\n\nI like this place the most compared to any other Hawaiian bbq spot out here is that they serve Meat jun and the sides.  Meat Jun is thinly sliced marinated beef that is egg battered, then pan fried, and served with a slightly spicy sauce. It is also a Korean entree that originated from Hawaii so don't really expect to find this at any other Korean restaurants.\n\nI recommend people to try this place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "i_H_yKtISROjQ4eruSwyPw"},

Front door was wide open. Nice little place - got seated immediately and attended to by a fairly nice waitress. Imagine my surprise when I checked the menu and saw Vietnamese pho! I'm a big fan, and while I was guessing it wouldn't be up to par with more centrally-located places like Pho Thanh I decided to give it a shot. The wife had massaman curry which she asked to be made quite spicy (\"Thai Hot\" as they call it). My pho, as predicted, wasn't that great. The meat was cut into thick chunks and the broth was actually sweet! I called one of the servers over and asked about it - they said that the cook was used to Thai dishes and had put a little too much sugar in as that's the norm with other stuff like the satay sauce etc. Fair enough, like I said I was expecting it. Taste aside, it wasn't a huge bowl and it was $10 - very much overpriced. I honestly don't know why I got it at a Thai restaurant, I suppose it's just because I like it so much that when I saw it on the menu my eyes glazed over. Like getting a burger at a Dairy Queen or something? (shrug) Anyways, the wife thoroughly enjoyed her curry - quite spicy but not too spicy for her. Note that she was charged an extra $1 for brown rice - a little too nickel-and-dimey for my liking. My kid had his usual chicken satay sticks. The chicken was dry and leathery, so marks dropped for that. Decor was nice, menu was done very well (see my photo).\n\nAll in all a fairly average experience. We'll be back to check out other dishes (Thai ones! *8-) and to support this new local business, but these folk certainly have a lot of catching up to do before they draw level with Line Thai in Sun City and (so far) wouldn't be our first choice for lunch or dinner going forward if we were starving.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_K5cfCM7-zQZ1hXdbsc2fQ"},
